### STAGE I WEB CRAWLING
We wrote the web crawlers and parsers to collect data on [YELP](https://www.yelp.com) and [ZOMATO](https://www.zomato.com). 

The data includs roughly 3000 restaurants in four cities: Chicago, New York City, San Fransisco, and Seattle. We collect the fundatmental information, such as telephone number, address, zip code; and also some additional highlights information including delivery services, take out services, outdoor seating and Wifi.
